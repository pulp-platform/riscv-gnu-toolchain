/* Invoke DEF_RISCV_FTYPE (NARGS, LIST) for each prototype used by
   RISCV built-in functions, where:

      NARGS is the number of arguments.
      LIST contains the return-type code followed by the codes for each
        argument type.

   Argument- and return-type codes are either modes or one of the following:

      VOID for void_type_node
      INT for integer_type_node
      POINTER for ptr_type_node
      V2H for opaque_V2HI_type_node
      V4Q for opaque_V4QI_type_node

   (we don't use PTR because that's a ANSI-compatibillity macro).

   Please keep this list lexicographically sorted by the LIST argument.  */
